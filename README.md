# 8042 clock

This is the firmware for a clock using the 8042 MCU described at [Hackaday](https://hackaday.io/project/161909-8042-clock). The circuit design can be found [here](https://github.com/kenyapcomau/8042-board).

Note that using direct segment drive instead of the TM1637 requires a 374 latch on port 1, which is not in the board design above.
